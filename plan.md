ILP reorganization note (2026-10-19)

I moved the minimal Metagol-style ILP scaffold from forward-engine/ to ilp_learner/ to keep ILP experimentation code grouped.

Files moved/added:
- ilp_learner/metagol_nds.py  (learner + demo)
- ilp_learner/synth_generator.py
- ilp_learner/run_demo.sh
- ilp_learner/README.md
- ilp_learner/__init__.py

Next steps:
- Replace the string-similarity prior in metagol_nds.embedding_prior with the repo's Lorentz hyperbolic prior and predicates' embeddings.
- Generate synthetic nDS datasets from pot-demo and run systematic ILP experiments.
- Integrate ILP learner into the LT/DLN evaluation harness when the prior and datasets are ready.

2026-10-19 update: align_ontology predicate extraction fix
- Problem: align_ontology was feeding outer functors (e.g. "predicate(?e1, buy)." -> "predicate") into ontology_classify, producing no labeled tokens and NaN contrastive loss.
- Fix: align_ontology now extracts inner verb tokens from "predicate(..., VERB)" and ignores non-verb functors (agent, patient, quantity, etc.). A short 50-epoch run on GSM8K produced non-NaN loss and saved aligned embeddings.

Recommended immediate next steps
1) Run a longer GSM8K alignment (200–500 epochs) using the fixed extractor to produce more stable embeddings for ILP priors.
2) Expand ontology mappings (VERB_ALIASES/_*_VERBS) or add a small heuristic clustering to increase coverage beyond the current ~85 labeled tokens.
3) Re-run ilp_learner/run_verbose_demo.py to observe prior scores and then run ILP experiments with the new GSM8K-aligned embeddings.
4) Decide whether to keep large .pt files in repo checkpoints or store them externally and reference by checksum (to control repo size).

I committed the fix and the short-run artifacts; tell me which of the recommended next steps to start and I'll proceed.
